Shadows.js
==

2D shadows, drawn using [paper.js], and ES6
Inspired by the soldiers' view field in Commandos, I wanted to implement it for the general case. 

This is the 4th attempt at attacking this problem (previous slow/buggy implementation at [Shadows.js])

See the [demo page]  
Run the [tests]  

Finally working!

It's in a fully functional state, and demo allows the user to move the light source, in several rooms.

Todo:
--
1. Optimize in busy rooms
2. Allow user to add shapes/lines in the demo app
